AM CURRENTLY PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT BOOSTRAP COLUMN WIDTHS TO FIT WITH DIFFERENT SCREEN SIZES.  THEN WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTENT IS CENTERED ON EACH SCREEN SIZE

To prevent a Bootstrap card from overflowing the screen, you can use a combination of CSS and Bootstrap classes. Here are a few tips:

DONE Use the container class: Wrap your card in a Bootstrap container to ensure it is responsive.
DONE Add overflow-hidden to the card: This will hide any overflowing content.
Use img-fluid for images: This class makes images responsive within the card.
Utilize table-responsive for tables: If your card contains a table, this class will make the table scrollable on smaller screens.
Here's an example:


<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <title>Bootstrap Card Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="card overflow-hidden">
      <img src="image.jpg" class="card-img-top img-fluid" alt="...">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card Title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">#</th>
                <th scope="col">First</th>
                <th scope="col">Last</th>
                <th scope="col">Handle</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">1</th>
                <td>Mark</td>
                <td>Otto</td>
                <td>@mdo</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">2</th>
                <td>Jacob</td>
                <td>Thornton</td>
                <td>@fat</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.5.4/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
This example ensures that the card content, including images and tables, will not overflow the screen on smaller devices12.
