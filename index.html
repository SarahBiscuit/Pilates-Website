                <p>PUT INFO HERE FROM ORIGINAL WEBSITE ON HOW PILATES WORKS
                    Pilates is an excellent way to improve strength, flexibility and muscle tone, and can be adapted for all fitness levels. It incorporates wieght-bearing and resistance training, and can be done with or without weights.  It teaches body awareness, and controlled movement, as well as promoting good posture and flexibility.  Professional athletes, dancers, celebrities and supermodels have used it for decades to increase strength and maintain a healthy physique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It works by teaching you to find and use the core muscles that act like a corset around your trunk.  Improving strength in these muscles gives more support to the spine and torso.  Pilates strengthens internal muscles while toning the visible ones, resulting in better postural awareness and a more slender appearance.
                </p>
                <p>Pilates has significant medical benefits, as detailed below, and is a great complement to sporting activities and training, providing balance and stability, in addition to the core strength and flexibility needed to avoid injury.</p>
                <p>
                    Pilates can be modified to be continued throughout pregnancy.  After your baby is born, it is an excellent postnatal tool to help restore lost muscle tone, particularly pelvic floor weakness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you are familiar with the principles of pilates you can tailor the movements to your personal needs.
